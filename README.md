# Introduction
-	The "Smart Bag" project leverages the capabilities of the ESP-32 microcontroller to enhance the functionality and safety features of traditional bags. This innovative application integrates advanced sensors, specifically designed for fall detection and spill detection, to create a smart and responsive bag system. The incorporation of fall detection sensors ensures that the bag can discern abrupt movements associated with falls, providing a safety net for users. Additionally, spill detection sensors contribute to the bag's intelligence by identifying liquid spills, safeguarding valuable contents and preventing potential damage.

# Requirements
For running the code, make sure that you have the required hardware.

# Contribution 
**This section provides instructions and details on how to submit a contribution via a pull request. It is important to follow these guidelines to make sure your pull request is accepted.**
1. Your pull request, if accepted, will only be branched, but never be merged since Internet of Things deals with hardware materials.
2. Before choosing to propose changes to this project, it is advisable to go through the readme.md file of the project to get the philosphy and the motive that went behind this project. The pull request should align with the philosphy and the motive of the original poster of this project.
3. To add your changes, make sure that the programming language in which you are proposing the changes should be same as the programming language that has been used in the project. The versions of the programming language and the libraries(if any) used should also match with the original code.
4. Write a documentation on the changes that you are proposing. The documentation should include the problems you have noticed in the code(if any), the changes you would like to propose, the reason for these changes, and sample test cases. Remember that the topics in the documentation is strictly not limited to the topics aforementioned, but are just an inclusion.
5. Submit a pull request via [Git etiquettes](https://gist.github.com/mikepea/863f63d6e37281e329f8)
